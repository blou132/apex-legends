# ChatGPT context index

Updated: 2026-08-13 (Phase5)

## Purpose

This file is the entry point for a new AI-assisted analysis session. The repository contains static and runtime observations about Apex Legends Mobile, Ghidra scripts, machine-readable exports, and the evidence needed to continue the investigation without relying on an earlier chat history.

The original game binaries, phone backups, raw logs, bulk function inventory, and local Ghidra database are intentionally not published. They remain local because they are proprietary, private, large, or unnecessary for reviewing the cleaned conclusions exported here.

## Read first

Use this order to avoid repeating conclusions that were later corrected:

1. `platform-tools/ApexMobileBackup/Analyse/Codex/Phase5/REPORT_PHASE5.md`
2. `platform-tools/ApexMobileBackup/Analyse/Codex/Phase4/REPORT_PHASE4.md`
3. `platform-tools/ApexMobileBackup/Analyse/Codex/Phase3/Phase3C/REPORT_PHASE3C.md`
4. `platform-tools/ApexMobileBackup/Analyse/Codex/Phase3/Phase3C/00_address_model.md`
5. The relevant topic report and matching JSON from the newest phase
6. Phase2 and Phase3B only as historical evidence, with Phase3C and later phases taking precedence

## Authoritative conclusions

- `CONFIRMED`: the Ghidra program uses image base `0x100000`.
- `CONFIRMED`: convert an ELF virtual address with `GHIDRA_ADDRESS = ELF_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS + 0x100000`.
- `INVALIDATED`: Phase3B conclusions that used Phase2 ELF virtual addresses directly as Ghidra addresses.
- `INVALIDATED`: `FUN_07941d10` as the direct corrected candidate for `RequestAvatarServerList`.
- `PROBABLE`: corrected containing functions for its two code references are `FUN_07a41d0c` at `0x7a41d0c` and `FUN_07a41d4c` at `0x7a41d4c`.
- `CONFIRMED`: `RequestAvatarServerList -> FUN_07a31858 -> FUN_06bc68e8` builds an HTTP GET.
- `CONFIRMED`: callback vtable `0xa732320`, adapter `FUN_06be413c`, handler `FUN_06be3bdc`.
- `CONFIRMED`: the callback emits event `0x138` through `FUN_06be3f4c` with success plus a response-body `FString`.
- `CONFIRMED`: `FUN_06bc6ca0` clones the callback delegate; it is not the response handler.
- `UNKNOWN`: the concrete GET URL, supplied dynamically as a UFunction `FString` argument.
- `UNKNOWN`: the response wire format and server-list fields; the native callback does not parse them.
- `UNKNOWN`: a proven `LoginMgr -> RequestAvatarServerList` call path.
- `CONFIRMED`: `EVENTID_AVATARSERVERLIST_RETURN = 0x138 / 312` and is emitted in the response path.
- `PROBABLE`: `GameServerBackupIpList` belongs to `Login` and is a `TArray<FName>`; offset `0x150` is `CONFIRMED`, while the writer and element contents are `UNKNOWN`.
- `UNKNOWN`: whether `SyncPayloadToGameServer` is an Unreal RPC and which native function implements it.
- `UNKNOWN`: the effective UEDSToolkit transport.
- `UNKNOWN`: the consumer of event `0x138`, the writer of `GameServerBackupIpList`, and a complete game-server connection path.
- `CONFIRMED`: several configuration, update, login, telemetry, payment, and voice endpoints exist in the artifacts; none is proven to be a game-server endpoint.

## Repository map

- `platform-tools/ApexMobileBackup/Analyse/Codex/01_endpoints.md`: confirmed and rejected endpoint indicators.
- `platform-tools/ApexMobileBackup/Analyse/Codex/02_server_flow.md`: conservative backend flow reconstruction.
- `platform-tools/ApexMobileBackup/Analyse/Codex/03_logs.md`: runtime log findings.
- `platform-tools/ApexMobileBackup/Analyse/Codex/04_pak_analysis.md`: PAK observations and limits.
- `platform-tools/ApexMobileBackup/Analyse/Codex/Phase2/`: static-resource and binary-context research before Ghidra.
- `platform-tools/ApexMobileBackup/Analyse/Codex/Phase3/`: Ghidra installation, import, scripts, initial reports, and raw execution evidence.
- `platform-tools/ApexMobileBackup/Analyse/Codex/Phase3/Phase3B/`: deeper exports produced before the address-model correction.
- `platform-tools/ApexMobileBackup/Analyse/Codex/Phase3/Phase3C/`: corrected address model, corrected exports, invalidations, and current conclusions.
- `platform-tools/ApexMobileBackup/Analyse/Codex/Phase4/`: Unreal registration tables and the first confirmed request runtime path.
- `platform-tools/ApexMobileBackup/Analyse/Codex/Phase5/`: HTTP callback, response event, URL-source and downstream storage analysis.

## Machine-readable evidence

- `Phase3/output/elf_libUE4_summary.json`: ELF structure summary.
- `Phase3/output/ghidra_nearest_functions.json`: nearest-function lookups used by the earlier analysis.
- `Phase3/Phase3B/output/*.json`: target callgraph and xref exports; interpret addresses through Phase3C corrections.
- `Phase3/Phase3C/output/*.json`: corrected target exports and address mapping.
- `Phase4/output/*.json`: Unreal registration tables, event metadata, property metadata, and request runtime probe.
- `Phase5/output/*.json`: request construction, callback vtables, response event, response representation, storage check, and SyncPayload thunk.

The full 467,079-function inventory and raw Ghidra execution logs remain local-only. Their relevant results are summarized in the reports and smaller JSON files committed here.

## Evidence rules

- Cite the source file and exact address for every technical conclusion.
- Keep `CONFIRMED`, `PROBABLE`, `UNKNOWN`, and `INVALIDATED` distinct.
- Do not infer a network endpoint from a nearby string alone.
- Do not infer a native implementation from the containing function alone.
- Do not reuse a Phase2 or Phase3B address without applying and validating the image-base correction.
- Prefer corrected Phase3C JSON over prose when checking exact values.

## Best next analysis targets

1. Resolve the Lua/Blueprint/event consumer of `EVENTID_AVATARSERVERLIST_RETURN` (`0x138`).
2. From that consumer, identify the response parser and prove individual server-list fields.
3. Prove a concrete `Login` instance before looking for writes at `Login+0x150`.
4. Resolve the dynamic UFunction caller that supplies the URL `FString`.
5. Identify the concrete receiver/vtable behind `SyncPayloadToGameServer +0xa58`.
6. Trace reconnect and UEDSToolkit paths only from proven owners toward `Host`, `Port`, `FURL`, socket, HTTP, or resolver calls.

The HTTP response event is now confirmed. The concrete lobby, matchmaking, and game-server destination remain unknown.
